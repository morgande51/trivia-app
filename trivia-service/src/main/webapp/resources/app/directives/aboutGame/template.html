		<h1>Welcome to the Trivia App</h1>
		<p>
			This is a trivia app.  It plays similar to that really famous Trivia game show on TV.  You know the one!
		<p>
		<p>
			It is written 100% in standard Java APIs. That means no external frameworks or libraries.  
			Check out the source code on GitHub, and find out more about Enterprise Java, now called <a href="https://jakarta.ee/" target="_blank">Jakarta EE</a> and <a href="https://thorntail.io/" target="_blank">Thorntail</a> from RedHat's JBoss Group.
